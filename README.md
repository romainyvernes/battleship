## Battleship
### Description
React-based render of the gameboard classic that demonstrates the use of factory functions and IIFEs with a simple AI as the opponent.
### Instructions
Start by placing your five ships horizontally or vertically within the board. Then, take aim at the enemy's ships by clicking on a chosen location on their board. But be prepared to be fired upon in return. The first player to sink the other's ships wins the game.
